## Shibboleth V3.0 Identity Provider Deployment using Docker

This projects is a workspace in which I am experimenting with deploying the
[Shibboleth](http://shibboleth.net)
[V3.0 Identity Provider](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/Home)
software using the [Docker](http://www.docker.com) container technology.

There's no guarantee that anything here actually works, but if you find
something useful you're welcome to take advantage of it.
